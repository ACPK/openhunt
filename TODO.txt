- bucket projects by date (weekends are a single bucket)
- infinite scrolling
- load more projects for a single date

- add user login panel (with icon)

- Email List subscription (form shown after the first bucket)

- leave feedback for project owner
- view feedback as project owner
- verify as project owner to see feedback (each project has a private key, and we email it to something @domain.com)


minor tweaks:
X responsive pass, fix navbar
- replicate the validations of ProductHunt (ask ash)
- minify assets, remove glyphicon fonts

- better login (via popup instead of redirect)
