      %p
        Open Hunt top goal is to be run by and for the community.
        To accomplish this, key decisions will be made by the <strong>Council</strong>
        elected by the community. The elected <strong>chief</strong> has the same vote as other members,
        but can also veto proposals.
      %p
        All council meetings will be conducted via Slack and publically posted.
        Proposals will be tracked and discussed via GitHub issues.
      %p
        Voting will be held a couple months after launch. The initial council consists of
        contributors to the initial site launch.
