    %p
      Open Hunt top goal is to be run by and for the community.
      To accomplish this, key decisions will be made by the <strong>Council</strong>
      elected by the community. The elected <strong>chief</strong> has the same vote as other members,
      but can also veto proposals.

    %p
      All council meetings will be conducted via Slack and publically posted.
      Proposals will be tracked and discussed via GitHub issues.

    %p
      Voting will be held a couple months after launch. The initial council consists of
      contributors to the initial site launch.
